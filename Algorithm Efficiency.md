- An algorithm is a set of instructions that, when executed, completes a defined task.
- To make algorithms more efficient you should take into account:
	- Space efficiency
	- Time efficiency
	- Big O
- ## Space efficiency
	- A measure of how much memory the code takes up
	- The two main measures of efficiency are time and space.
- ## Big O notation
	- O(1) – the function performance is constant and does not depend on N e.g. the _sum of all numbers_ function
	- O(n) – the algorithm performance changes linearly with N e.g. the for loop example for adding numbers
	- O(n!) – the algorithm is extremely sensitive to the input size and it rapidly becomes impractical e.g. using a brute force technique to sort N words in to alphabetical order
