- An algorithm is a set of instructions that, when executed, completes a defined task.
- To make algorithms more efficient you should take into account:
	- Space efficiency
	- Time efficiency
	- [[Big O Notation]]
- ## Space efficiency
	- A measure of how much memory the code takes up
	- The two main measures of efficiency are time and space.
