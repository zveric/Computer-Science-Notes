## Terminology
	- A word represents the number of bits that the computer can handle
	- A computer is any device or machine that can perform calculations.
	- A bus is a microscopic wire that carries data
		- There are 3 types of bus
			- Address bus
				- One directional, Carries the address requested
			- Data bus
				- Multi-directional, Carries data
			- Control Bus
				- Multi directional, From the control unit to the rest of the CPU
	- Registers are tiny slot in memory
		- Control unit coordinates the rest of the CPU
			- It contains a clock that keeps components of the CPU in time
		- The ALU carries out calculations
			- The accumulator (ACC) is a register within the ALU
		- Program counter (PC)
			- stores the next instruction that will be executed
		- CIR
			- stores the instruction that is currently being decoded or executed by the processor
		- MDR
			- Contains data that has just been written or is to be written to memory
