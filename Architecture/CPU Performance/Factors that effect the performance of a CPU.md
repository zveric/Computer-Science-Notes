- Clock Speed = Number of cycles per second
- Heat doesn't directly affect performance but heat over 80 Deg Centigrade can damage silicon inside the CPU
- Number of cores = A core is a complete processing unit within a CPU. This allows for more processes to occur at the same time. This can allow multitasking to happen.
- Cache = Super fast memory with the cpu. Use to temporally hold instructions and data the CPU is likely to reuse.
- RAM = Temporary storage of instructions.
- Word size = How many bits a CPU can cope with at once.
