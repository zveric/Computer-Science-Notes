If the accumulator (calculator) is 0 or positive, set the program counter to the value xx. Otherwise, do nothing. This means that the program jumps to another part of the code if the value in the acc is positive.

### Using pseudocode write a program for a procedural language that takes in two inputs and gives the same output as the program in Fig.1.
Num1 = int(input())
Num2 = int(input())

print(Num1 MOD Num2)
