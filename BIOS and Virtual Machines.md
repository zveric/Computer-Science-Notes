## Booting a Computer
- When a computer is first switched on the main memory is empty and the computer has no instructions to follow.
- Booting allows the operating system to be loaded from initial switch-on.
- It has to happen in small steps because at the point of switch-on the machine is effectively ignorant. 
- It does not know about any hard disks it may contain, or any peripherals such as the screen, keyboard, mouse - absolutely nothing.
- There is an established way of booting up a computer and the piece of software involved with this is called the BIOS.

## The BIOS
- The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is a small program that is responsible for booting up the computer. 
- It is not part of the operating system as it has to work before the operating system is even loaded and is normally stored on a BIOS chip on the motherboard. 
- This chip contains non-volatile memory: either ROM in older systems, or Flash memory in newer ones.
- The BIOS contains the most basic hardware settings of the computer and a set of instructions to begin the boot up process. 

- The first thing that happens when the 'on' switch is pressed is that the power supply fires up.
- A power supply can take a second or more to become stable. 
- Once it is producing a steady output, it sends a 'Hardware Reset' signal to the CPU. 
- This signal travels along a wire directly to the CPU (it is part of the control bus).

### POST
- POST (Power On Self Test) is the method that the computer uses to ensure that
