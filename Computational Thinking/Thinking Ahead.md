## Decompisition 
Breaking the system down in to smaller chunks allows a modular solution to be developed

### The inputs and outputs for each module will need to be identified as well as the following:
- Data type
- Structure of the data
- Validation
- Parameters
- Where will the input come from?
- What format will the output take?
- Preconditions
	- Things that are nessersary to have already occured. Before the code executes

## Caching
