## Data Protection Act
### The Data Protection Act is built around eight principles (rules) which state how personal data should be treated:
- Personal data must be fairly and lawfully processed. This means that an organisation must be truthful about what personal data they wish to collect and what they want to use it for.
- Personal data must be obtained for specified and lawful purposes. This means that an organisation cannot use personal data for any purpose other than that stated when they collected the data. For example, if a company wanted your exam records to see if you were qualified for a job, it could not use those records to try to sell you revision guides that it thinks you might need. Also, the company cannot pass on your data to any other organisation without your permission.
- Personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive. This means that an organisation cannot ask for any data that is not needed. For example, when you apply for a bank account the bank cannot ask you where you went on holiday last year.
- Personal data must be accurate and up to date. If data held about you is wrong or out of date, you have the right to have it corrected or deleted. This is extremely important, as incorrect or out-of-date data might, for example, prevent you from getting a job or a loan, or being able to buy a house.
- Personal data must not be kept for longer than is necessary. As soon as an organisation no longer needs your data, they must delete it.
- Personal data must be processed in line with your rights. This includes the right to see any data held on you and the right to correct inaccurate data.
- Personal data must be held securely. This means that data must be kept safe from unauthorised access - for example, with usernames and passwords - but also safe from accidental loss - by making backups.
- Personal data must not be transferred to other countries outside the European Economic Area unless those countries have similar data protection laws.
### Roles:
- Information commisioner: The person or office who has powers to enforce the act
- Data controller: is a person or company that collects and keeps data about people
- Data subject: The person whos data it is that is being stored
#### Data subjects rights:
- The right to be informed
- The right of access
- The right to rectification
- The right to erasure
- The right to restrict processing
- The right to data portability
- The right to object
- Rights about automated decision making and profiling.

## GDPR
### GDPR specifies that personal data must be:
- processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner - this means organisations need to tell people what data is being stored and what it will be used for, including cookies on websites, online forms and apps
- collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes - the data cannot be used for anything other than what it was originally collected for
- adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed - data cannot be collected that is not relevant to the organisationâ€™s needs
- accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date - individuals have the right to request that data is changed but it is also the responsibility of the organisation to make sure that the data is correct
- kept in a format which identifies individuals for no longer than is necessary - data can be kept for longer as long as anything that identifies the individual is removed
- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures - in other words, an organisation must take adequate actions to ensure that the data is safe from accidental loss and cyberattacks
