## Truth Tables
Truth tables are used to see all the possible results of a operation

## Logic Diagrams
Shows the logic of a operation through a series of gates 

### Not gate (Â¬A, A with hat on)
Outputs the opposite of the input.

### AND gate (A^B, A.B)
Outputs true only if both inputs are true.

### OR gate (AvB, A+B)
If either a or b is true then output true 

### XOR (A_V_B, A(+)B)
Only if 1 value is true return true

### NAND
AND followed by NOT 

### NOR
OR followed by NOT

## NANDOR = order of operations, The chicken eating wizard = NOT, AND, OR
