- Every location in memory has a unique address.
- There are many ways to access this data. These are called memory address modes
- Memory includes the internal registers of the CPU, and cache as well as external RAM
- ## Immediate Addressing
	- The data that is going to be used is hard-coded into the instruction.
	- This is the fastest type of addressing as the main memory isn't needed.
	- Example: y = x + 2
	- Useful for constants
- ## Direct Addressing
	- The code references the individual memory address required.
	- This means that if the data moves from the memory address hard-coded into the code the code will break
	- It isn't a good idea to use direct on a computer that is being used to run multiple programs however it is well suited for computers running a single program
- ## Indirect Addressing
	- The addresses are stored in a lookup table
	- The operand acts as a pointer telling the CPU where to find the data
	- It isn't confined by the size of the operand
	- Allows values to be moved
- ## Indexed Addressing
	- An index is added to the base address in the lookup table.
