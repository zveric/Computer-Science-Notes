- Nodes
	- Devices on the network
- NIC
	- Network Interface Cards
	- Each NIC has a MAC address
- A hub
	- A small box that link nodes together to form a network. They lack security as every node can view the data whether it was intended for them or not
	- If two or more computers on the network transmit data at exactly the same time a data collision will occur
- A switch
	- Similar to a hub however it only sends data to the node in the address.
- Router 
  id:: 6527a237-060e-4658-8e4a-6492f62323c3
	- Changes data from one network to another
- A Gateway
	- Similar to a router but connects two dissimilar networks (networks on different protocols)
