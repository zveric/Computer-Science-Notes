- Nodes are devices on the network
- NIC are Network Interface Cards
- Each NIC has a MAC address
- A hub is a small box that link nodes together to form a network. They lack security as every node can view the data whether it was intended for them or not
- If two or more computers on the network transmit data at exactly the same time a data collision will occur
- A switch is similar to a hub however it only sends data to the node in the address.
- Router changes data from one network to another
- A Gateway is similar to a router but connects two dissimilar networks (networks on different protocols)
