- The internet is a worldwide collection of computer networks that are connected together (Inter-networking).
- It is a WAN ([[Types of Network]])
- In order to join the Internet, every device needs a unique IP (Internet Protocol) Address.

## IP addresses 
- A numerical address made of 4 numbers each between 0 and 255 that uniquely identifies a device on a network.  
- It is a logical identifier (i.e. can change on a physical device). 
- It is allocated by software rather than hardware (unlike MAC addresses) and is used for routing data across WANs.
- An IP address contains two pieces of information:
	- The address of the network
	- The address of the node within the network (also known as a subnet address) which allows the data to reach the specific device

### IPv4 
- The most common type of IP address is IPv4 which allows each device to have a unique 32-bit binary number address.
- To improve readability this is broken in to 8 digit chunks which are then converted in to denary numbers.
- There are 4 billion possible unique IPv4 addresses.

### IPv6
- IPv6 uses 128 bits rather than 32 bits to generate addresses which give 2128 unique addresses.
- They are arranged asÂ groups of hexadecimal numbers

### Static IP addresses
- Used for web pages

### Dynamic IP addresses
- When a device is temporarily connected to the Internet a dynamic IP address is allocated to it.
- When the device disconnects, the IP address becomes available for another device to use.
- The dynamic address is generally allocated to a home router by the ISP when it connects.
- Each time you connect a different address may be allocated.
