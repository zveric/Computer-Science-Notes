## A procedural language
	- A procedural computer language is one that allows the programmer to set out, step by step, what the computer needs to do and how to do it.
	- is an imperative language, meaning that it gives orders or instructions.
	- is sequential, meaning that instructions carried out one after another. These steps form the program flow.
	- Has statements in blocks called procedures & functions. These statements are completed in a specific order.
- ## Procedures and Functions
	- Programs are written to perform specific tasks, but it is often useful to break a task down into smaller parts, and consider each separately.
	- Each of these smaller parts can be handled by separate blocks of code within the same program.
	- These blocks are called procedures or functions, and each procedure is given a unique identifier.
	- As the program runs, it will use these identifiers to call (run) the procedure or function as required
	- ### Procedures
		- Don't return a value
		- Performs an operation on arguments/parameter.
	- ### Functions
		- A function is a section of code named by an identifier.
		- It is called as part of an expression (in the main program)
		- It returns a single value when called  which replaces the function call in the main program.
		- A function takes one or more inputs which are called "arguments" (sometimes known as parameters).
	- ### Passing Parameters
		- #### By value:
			- Local copy of data is used then discarded, so value of original data is unchanged
		- #### By reference:
			- Actual memory location of data is used so changes can be made to the actual value of data
- ## Reserved Words
	- Reserved words are words that cannot be used as an identifier (i.e. the name of a variable, function or label) because they have a special meaning to the compiler.
	- They are also known as keywords, which are a subset of reserved words.
- ## File Handling
	- Some computer languages combine the 'Open' and 'Create' function so if the file does not exist, it is created.
	- Files can be opened in different access modes.
		- Read only - allows the file to be read but not modified
		- Write only - opens the file for writing into
		- Read-Write (update) - opens the file for both read and write. It may also create the file if it did not exist
		- Append - opens the file for adding to only. Existing data cannot be deleted
