A procedural computer language is one that allows the programmer to set out, step by step, what the computer needs to do and how to do it. 
A procedural language :
- is an imperative language, meaning that it gives orders or instructions.
- is sequential, meaning that instructions carried out one after another. These steps form the program flow.
- Has statements in blocks called procedures & functions. These statements are completed in a specific order.


## Procedures and Functions
Programs are written to perform specific tasks, but it is often useful to break a task down into smaller parts, and consider each separately. 
Each of these smaller parts can be handled by separate blocks of code within the same program.
These blocks are called procedures or functions, and each procedure is given a unique identifier. 
As the program runs, it will use these identifiers to call (run) the procedure or function as required
