1.  Write pseudocode that reads two numbers, multiplies them together and prints out their product.
   ~~~
num1 = int(input("Enter your first number"))
num2 = int(input("Enter your second number"))
if num1 or num2 != 5 or 6:
		print("Your number is not a 5 or 6")
num3 = num1 * num2
print(num3)

3. Write pseudocode that performs the following: 
- Ask a user to enter a number.
- If the number is between 0 and 9, write the word blue.
