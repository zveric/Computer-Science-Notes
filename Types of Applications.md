## Utility Software
- A utility is an application that has a very specific task to carry out. 
- It is often a small program in terms of programming code as it only needs to do one thing.
- An operating system usually has lots of utilities integrated into it

## Off-the-shelf (general purpose application)
- A general purpose application, sometimes known as ‘off-the-shelf’ is the sort of software that you use at home and school.
- Examples include word processors, spreadsheets, databases, desktop publishing packages, graphics packages etc.
- This type of software tries to be a ‘jack-of-all-trades’.
- It is relatively cheap
- It is easily available from most computer shops
- It will have been thoroughly tested so there won’t be any serious problems or bugs
- There will be lots of user support i.e. books, user guides, online help and discussion forums

## Custom Software
- There are some applications that have a very wide usage, but no two customers are the same. 
- Therefore off the shelf applications can be customised

## Bespoke Software
- Made from the ground up for a particular job
