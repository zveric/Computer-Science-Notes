## Programming Paradigms
- ### Low level
	- Geared towards a CPU family
	- Almost machine code
	- Code uses Mnemonics
	- Many different memory modes can be used
	- Labels are used to allow the code to jump
	- Good for close control of the CPU for maximum performance and efficiency
	- Very hard to port to other CPU's
	- Programmers need to know a large quantity of information about the CPU
- ### Object-orientated
	- Has classes and objects
	- Has protections for variables (attributes) this is called encapsulation
	- Makes it easier in some instances to provide working code
	- Classes can be used as black boxes and can be implemented without any information on the workings of the code
	- It is more complex than other types of programming languages
- ### Declarative
	- Very high level languages.
	- The developer simply states what to do and not how to do it.
	- It needs a database filled with rules and facts to function
	- If no answer can be found the program returns false
	- The statement doesn't have to be in a specific order
	- Uses fuzzy logic
	- Good for AI and Pattern Recognition
- ### Procedural
	- Programs are broken up into procedures and functions
	- Sometimes called imperative languages
	- SQL is a non procedural language as commands are simplified and the underlying program fills in the gaps
	- People often have to specialise in a particular language
	- Not as efficient as a low level language
	- Not good at fuzzy conditions
