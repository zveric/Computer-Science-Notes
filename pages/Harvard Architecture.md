- Used for embedded systems and super computers
- ### Features
	- Uses separate memory for data and programs
		- In theory this leads to less bottle necks and corruption
- ### Issues
	- More space used than [[Von Neumann Architecture]]
	- More complex than [[Von Neumann Architecture]] therefore more expensive to produce
